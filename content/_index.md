          I work as a researcher at the University of Oslo, Norway. My main
          research area is spoken language development of children with cochlear
          implants. I'm especially interested in the influence of the
          environment.
      - title: Data Visualisation
        content: >-
          I'm passionate about data visualisation. My main tool is R, but I am
          trying to get better with JavaScript.
      - title: Teaching R
        content: >-
          I work with the Carpentries, a volunteer organisation that teaches
          scientific computing skills to researchers. It's all about
          reproducible research and open science. 
      - title: Creative Coding
        content: >-
          I like to dabble in a lot of different tech stuff. I love exploring
          web technology, migrocomputing, AR/VR stuff, music with Sonic Pi. So
          many things, so little time...
